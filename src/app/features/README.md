# Features Directory

The features directory contains a collection of feature modules which are each independent of each other.
This allows Angular to load only the module it requires to display the request thereby saving bandwidth and speeding the entire application.

For more information read the module directory section in [angular-folder-structure](https://angular-folder-structure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html).
